<h4>Front-End Objectives:</h4>

<em>NOTE: SHARE NOW, in conjunction with its shareholders at Daimler AG and The BMW Group, has decided to exit the North American market and cease operations in London, Brussels and Florence, effective February 29, 2020.</em> 😢[Read Reference](https://www.share-now.com/us/en/important-update/)

Since there have been several changes to car share services and ultimately the shutdown of the Car2Go service in the US. I will no longer maintain this application. I will just keep the code here for reference. -Brian

<p>Close2Go's objective is to make Car2Go reservations even simpler by automatically reserving the nearest car. Close2Go also provides the option to monitor for any additional cars that appear closer than the current reservation to the users location. If one becomes available, the reservation will be swapped for the closer vehicle.</p>

I am developing the app using the following frameworks/run-time:

<ul>
<li>HTML/CSS/JavaScript</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>Google Maps SDK</li>
<li>JQuery</li>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
</ul>
